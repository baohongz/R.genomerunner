Scripts and examples of visualization and analysis of the enrichment and epigenomic similarity results
========================================================

Scripts for processing of the enrichment analysis matrixes produced by [GenomeRunner Web](http://www.genomerunner.org) of [GenomeRunner](http://sourceforge.net/projects/genomerunner/). The scripts are developed and best used with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)

* `Analysis.pdf` - Coming soon (before 02/10/2014). Main tutorial for the enrichment and epigenomic similarity analysis and visualization in R.

* `00_data_load.R` - Prepare the environment and load the data.

* `01_heatmap_corr.R` - Code snippets to perform enrichment- and epigenomic similarity analyses clustering and visualization, as well as some exploratory tests.

* `utils.R` - Functions used by main scripts.

* `temp.R` - Temporary and experimental code snippets.
