Epigenomic Element	Alias	Description	Disease AssociationsH3k4me1	Histone 3 monomethylated lysine 4	Promoters and enhancers. Localized to transcription start sites of genes and is linked to active transcription.	DiabetesH3k4me2	Histone 3 dimethylated lysine 4	Promoters and enhancers. Localized to transcription start sites of genes and is linked to active transcription.	"Lung, prostate and kidney cancer "H3k4me3	Histone 3 trimethylated lysine 4	"Promoters. Localized to transcription start sites of genes and is linked to active transcription. Important for the elongation of HLA-DRA genes and in mice, maintaining the poised state of stem cells for activation or repression. "	"Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis and gastric cancer"H3k9me1	Histone 3 monomethylated lysine 9	Active chromatin	H3k9me3	Histone 3 trimethylated lysine 9 	"Constitutive heterochromatin. However, a study does suggest that it is also present at differentially expressed genes in cancers (PMID: 17968314). Reports suggest the presence of this site at silent as well as transcribed regions of the genome (PMID: 16061184). H3K9me3 is also important for transcriptional elongation of MHC II HLA-DRA genes (PMID: 17478518)."	"Diabetes, Fragile-X syndrome, Acute myeloid leukemia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Acute meyloid leukemia, prostate cancer"H3k9ac	Histone 3 acetylated lysine 9	Promoters. Localization near the TSS is essential for transcription activation. Important for immune response in interferon gamma transcription. Important for MHC II HLA DRA gene elongation. Helps in DNA damage repair by recruitment of damage repair machinery. 	"Pituitary adenomas, lung cancer, fatty liver disease"H3k27me3	Histone 3 trimethylated lysine 27	Gene repression. Roles in imprinted and random X inactivation.  Important for the commitment to the neural lineage.  In mice it is important for maintaining the poised state of stem cells for activation or repression.  	"Epithelial ovarian cancer, Fragile X syndrome, T cell leukemia/lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma/lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, breast cancer, colon cancer, "H3k27ac	Histone 3 acetylated lysine 27	Active regulatory regions. Localizes to the TSS's of active and poised genes.	H3k36me3	Histone 3 trimethylated lysine 36	H3K36 methylation restricts the PRC2 mediated spread of H3K27 methylation (PMID: 21239496). Associated with transcribed regions.	H3k79me2	Histone 3 dimethylated lysine 79	"Transcription transition, elongation"	leukemiaH4k20me1	Histone 4 monomethylated lysine 20	Transcription elongation. Monomethylated H4K20 and H3K9 act cooperatively to mark distinct regions of silent chromatin within the mammalian epigenome (PMID: 16517599). H4K20 methylation status (mono- or di-) contributes to chromosome behaviour during mitosis and proper cytokinesis (PMID: 15200950).	CTCF	CCCTC-Binding Factor	Insulator binding protein that can regulate imprinted expression by binding DNA insulators and blocking communication between promoters and downstream enhancers	"breast cancer, prostate cancer, and Wilms' tumors"H2az	H2A Histone Family Member Z (H2AFZ)	Enriched upstream and downstream of TSS's and at insulators.
